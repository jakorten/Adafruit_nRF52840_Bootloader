# Adafruit nRF52840 Bootloader

This repository contains the USB bootloader for Adafruit nRF52840 boards (1MB
flash, 256KB SRAM). This repository depend on  [tinyusb](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb/tree/develop) as submodule. After
cloning this repo you need to run the following command:

    git submodule update --init

## Option 1: Build with makefile

Navigate to `src/singlebank` (recommended) or `src/dualbank` (work in progress),
and use feather52840 target for building bootloader.

	make feather52840

To flash bootloader + S140

	make flash_feather52840

To only flash S140

	make flash_sd

### Common makefile problems

#### 1. `arm-none-eabi-gcc`: No such file or directory

If you get the following error ...

    $ make feather52840
    Compiling file: dfu_single_bank.c
    /bin/sh: /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc: No such file or directory
    make: *** [_build/dfu_single_bank.o] Error 127

... you may need to edit the `Makefile` (for example `src/singlebank/Makefile`),
and update the `GNU_INSTALL_ROOT` to point to the root path of your GCC ARM
toolchain.

#### 2. `mergehex: No such file or directory`

Make sure that `mergehex` is available from the command-line. This binary is
part of of Nordic's [nRF5x Command Line Tools](http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.tools%2Fdita%2Ftools%2Fnrf5x_command_line_tools%2Fnrf5x_installation.html).

#### 3. `make: nrfjprog: No such file or directory`

Make sure that `nrfjprog` is available from the command-line. This binary is
part of of Nordic's [nRF5x Command Line Tools](http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.tools%2Fdita%2Ftools%2Fnrf5x_command_line_tools%2Fnrf5x_installation.html).

On POSIX-type systems you can temporarily add the path to `nrfjprog` via a
variation on the following command:

```
$ export PATH=$PATH:/Users/Kevin/Downloads/nRF5x-Command-Line-Tools_9_7_2_OSX/nrfjprog
```

## Option 2: Build using Segger Embedded Studio

For better debugging you can also use [SES](https://www.segger.com/products/development-tools/embedded-studio/).
The project file is located at `src/segger/nrf52840_bootloader.emProject`.

> **Note**: SES only flashes the bootloader when you click download, you need to
flash Softdevice beforehand if you haven't done so ( use `make flash_sd`
mentioned above )
